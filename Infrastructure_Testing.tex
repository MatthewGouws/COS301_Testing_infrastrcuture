\section{Introduction} % added by Andrew but please read over it and make corrections
This document contains:
Part 1 the functional testing phase for each mid level parts Buzz A and Buzz B.
Each section with show the success or the failure of each part. This contains all violations of the contract requirements.
pre- and post- conditions should be tested for all the violation and the data structure requirements.
For all the testing, an analysis report of the percentage cases will be given that will depict the amount of work done and the successfulness of the sections in the implementation

Part 2 the non-functional testing phase.
This part contains the performance, scalability, maintainability, reliability, usability of the application and problems associate with the system.

\section{Purpose} % purpose seems to be in order
The purpose of this task was to test functionality provided by mid-level integration for infrastructure, which consisted of Notification, Authorization, Spaces and CSDS.


\section{Project Scope} % To be filled in at a later stage
The scope of the integration for infrastructure was to combine all functional teams code in a manner which could be used by top level integration. From what has been discovered and explained further in this document it shows that both teams A and B have failed to do so. Team A was very difficult to try and decipher. With missing dependencies, while Team B only had mock functionality.

\section{Functional} %specify the use cases as in the MasterSpecifications - Table format, Compare A vs B

Use Case(s) & Buzz A & Buzz B \\ 
\hline
Daily Email - Sends Daily Email. & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run & Only Mock functionality, does not run \\ %

Delete Notification - Checks if the user should receive a notification & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run & Only Mock functionality, does not run\\ %
\hline
Edit Notification Settings - Edits the notifications  & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run & Only Mock functionality, does not run\\ %
\hline
Web Notification - returns a list of notifications for the specified user & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run & Only Mock functionality, does not run \\ %
\hline
Register For Notification - Allows a user to register for notifications on a thread, to specified users  & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run & Only Mock functionality, does not run \\ %
\hline
Standard Notification - When a user adds a new thread it sends notifications to a list of registered users & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run &  Only Mock functionality, does not run\\ %
