\section{Introduction} % added by Andrew but please read over it and make corrections
					   % This section read over by Matthew(The original one)
This document contains:
Part 1 the functional testing phase for each mid level parts Buzz A and Buzz B.
Each section will show the success or the failure of each part. This contains all violations of the contract requirements.
Pre- and post- conditions should be tested for all the violations and the data structure requirements.
For all the testing, an analysis report of the percentage cases will be given that will depict the amount of work done and the successfulness of the sections in the implementation.

Part 2 the non-functional testing phase.
This part contains the performance, scalability, maintainability, reliability, usability of the application and problems associated with the system.

\section{Purpose} % purpose seems to be in order
The purpose of this task was to test functionality provided by mid-level integration for infrastructure, which consisted of Notification, Authorization, Spaces and CSDS.


\section{Project Scope} % To be filled in at a later stage
The scope of the integration for infrastructure was to combine all functional teams code in a manner which could be used by top level integration. From what has been discovered and explained further in this document it shows that both teams A and B have failed to do so. Team A was very difficult to try and decipher. With missing dependencies, while Team B only had mock functionality.

\section{Functional} %specify the use cases as in the MasterSpecifications - Table format, Compare A vs B

Register For Notification - Allows a user to register for notifications on a thread, to specified users  & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run & Only Mock functionality, does not run \\ %
\hline
Standard Notification - When a user adds a new thread it sends notifications to a list of registered users & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run &  Only Mock functionality, does not run\\ %

\subsubsection{Spaces}%NOTE: This table consists of all the use-cases under spaces
\begin{tabular}{|p{4.5cm}|p{4.5cm}|p{4.5cm}|}

\hline
Use Case(s) & Buzz A & Buzz B \\

Create Buzz Space - Creates and adds the buzz space to the activated list of buzz spaces. & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run &  \\ %
\hline
Close Buzz Space - Receives buzz to close and then removes the buzz space from the list of activated buzz spaces. & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run & \\ %
\hline
Assign Administrator - Gets the user to be assigned to be administrator then checks if it is administrator and adds the user to the list of administrators.  & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run & \\ %
\hline
Remove Administrator - Receives the user to be removed then removes the user from the list of admin. & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run &  \\ %
\hline
Is Administrator - Receives the user to be checked then searches the admin list for the user.  & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run &  \\ %
\hline
Get User Profile -  Searchs for the user that is queried and returns the user searched for. & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run &  \\ %
\hline
Register On Buzz Space - Registers the user on buzz spaces and stores the user in the database. & Could not npm install, Missing dependencies, thus would not run &  \\ %
\hline

\section{Non-functional} %Please correct me if I am wrong on these headings % seems all in order
\subsection{Performance}
%Axel please add here
As stated for the B system, A would run similarly in performance due to the use of NodeJS and MongoDB, With the code very difficult to track down and run, the true performance could not be tested for the system, but given a decent entry level server would be expected to handle multiple client connections at once.
\subsection{Scalability}
%Axel please add here (Your work seems to cover A and B)
Stub - This will be added in the future
\subsection{Maintainability}
%Axel please add here
Due to the fact that the code is very difficult to access in the repository for A it is highly unlikely it can be called maintainable. However unit tests seem to have been completed and thus would be easy to add specific extra cases to the code while ensuring it does not break the known working code.
\subsection{Reliability}
Stub - This will be added in the future
\subsection{Usability}
%Axel please add here
Due to the fact that the code is barely traceable to where it is located, it is very difficult to use this package. Insight into the development would be required to allow a user to be able to use the code correctly and how to use the code before production could begin.
\subsection{Availability}
Stub - This will be added in the future

\subsection{Manageability}
Stub - This will be added in the future
\subsection{Security}
Stub - This will be added in the future
\subsection{Monitorability and Auditability}
Stub - This will be added in the future
\subsection{Integrability}
Stub - This will be added in the future
